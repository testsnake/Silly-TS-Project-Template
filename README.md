# Silly TS Project Template

A template for making silly little typescript projects

This template is very specific to my own personal use cases, using both settings and tools I personally like using for short projects.

Uses [PNPM](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm), [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino), featuring basic GitHub workflow scripts.
